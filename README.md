# react-simple-snake updated w/ Game For Crypto Integration

 Open source simple snake react game, wrapped in a simple integration with Game For Crypto. The snake game was originally developed by MaÃ«l Drapier (github repo: https://github.com/MaelDrapier/react-simple-snake), I made a modification to the starting conditions for the snake, and wrapped it in a simple GFC API react component which connects to contests, and posts scores back to Game For Crypto.

Game For Crypto, GFC, is a platform developed to act as an online arcade, where gamers can win cryptocurrency based on gaming challenges.

Contests are created by gamers, and an entry fee is set (in credits). Each gamer who joins the contest must pay the entry fee. These credits are acquired by using the GFC front end, and cost .0001 ETH per credit.

The first gamer to complete the conditions of the contest, or with the highest score at the end of the contest wins!

Credits are stored on the GFC smart contract linked to Ethereum address / Gamer Name. Gamers can withdraw credits at anytime, which is returned as ETH to the gamers ETH wallet.
